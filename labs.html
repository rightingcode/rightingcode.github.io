There are 8 assignments to complement the lectures and impart hands-on experience.
Each assignment is of one of the following two kinds:
<ul>
<li>Using a software analysis tool based on a technique covered in lectures, reporting your findings, and
answering conceptual questions.</li>
<li>Implementing a software analysis algorithm in a high-level programming language (usually Java).</li>
</ul>
A VM image compatible with both Virtualbox and VMWare is provided for relevant
assignments. (It should also work with other virtualization software but only
these two are officially supported.)
