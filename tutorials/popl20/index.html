<p>
Program reasoning has important and wide-ranging applications in programming languages,
such as type inference, static analysis, testing, verification, and synthesis. This tutorial will cover
how to build program reasoning tools using two versatile, modern, and open-source systems:
the LLVM compiler infrastructure and the Z3 constraint solver. These systems underlie
state-of-the-art tools such as Clang Static Analyzer, the KLEE symbolic execution engine, and
the SeaHorn verification framework.

<p>
This tutorial will introduce LLVM and Z3’s architecture and conduct three hands-on exercises.
They will target common applications in program reasoning that embody three distinctive
use-cases: static dataflow analysis, dynamic symbolic execution, and assertion verification.
The target audience for this tutorial is those who want hands-on experience with state-of-the-art
tools and techniques employed in program reasoning. The tutorial presumes background in C++
programming and basic logical reasoning.

<p>
We will teach how to build program reasoning tools via three hands-on exercises.
The tutorial will be structured into two parts:

<ol>
<li>
We will first introduce the systems which form the backbone of our applications. In
particular, we will cover:
<ol>
<li>LLVM, a compiler infrastructure primarily targeting the C family of languages. It is a
versatile framework that is widely used in both industry and academia. We will introduce
the architecture of LLVM as well as its language-independent intermediate
representation (IR).</li>
<li>Z3, an efficient SMT solver developed by Microsoft Research that is used for a variety of
computational problems in programming languages and beyond. We will introduce the
architecture of Z3, its capabilities, and its API. However, we will not delve into the
internals of Z3.</li>
</ol>
<li>We will then conduct hands-on exercises on building three applications. Each exercise will cover a distinctive use-case:
<ol>
<li>
<b>Static Dataflow Analysis.</b> This task involves statically proving simple program
properties that are commonly targeted by dataflow analysis and type inference.</li>
<li>
<b>Dynamic Symbolic Execution.</b> This task involves systematically generating program
inputs that lead to assertion violations.</li>
<li>
<b>Assertion Verification.</b> This task involves statically proving assertions by generating
and solving Constrained Horn Clauses (CHC), a fragment of First Order Logic increasingly used
in verification, inference, and synthesis.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
